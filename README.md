# DevTools
DevTools is a plugin that has a bunch of utilities that Spigot plugin developers may find useful. It is designed to be run in local test servers. 

**WARNING: This plugin may use up a hefty amount of resources depending on what you're doing with it.**

# Disclaimer
This plugin has only been tested for Spigot. Using Paper or other forks of Spigot may not work as intended, as [they may load Bukkit classes in differently](https://github.com/classgraph/classgraph/discussions/537#discussioncomment-1152567). Currently, there are no plans to support Spigot forks.
